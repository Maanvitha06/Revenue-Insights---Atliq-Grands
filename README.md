# Revenue-Insights---Atliq-Grands

**Problem Statement**
Atliq Grands is the owner of numerous five-star hotels. They have 20 years of experience in the hotel sector. Atliq Grands are losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment as a result of strategic actions made by rivals and management errors. The managing director of Atliq Grands made the decision to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" as a tactical step to reclaim market share and income. They do not, however, have a data analytics team on staff to give them these insights.

In order to gain insights from their historical data, their revenue management team had made the decision to acquire a third-party service provider.
